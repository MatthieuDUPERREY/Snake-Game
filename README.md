# Snake-Game

This Snake is a part of my Ironhack bootcamp, a formation in Web Development that I started in June 2022.
It's the first project of the first module that contain the program.

The main here is to create an MVP video game.
I decided to create a snake game because I think it was the first game I ever played on an old computer when I was kid.

The rules are simples : You have to eat the insect without touch the border of the screen. You add 20 point every time. But every time you eat the target, the speed of your snake increase.
